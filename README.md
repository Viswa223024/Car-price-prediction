**🚗 Car Price Data Analysis Project**

This project is about exploring and understanding how different factors affect car prices. I worked with a dataset that contains details such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, transmission, and condition. My goal was to analyze the data and visualize interesting patterns — not to build a machine learning model.
The entire analysis was done in Google Colab using Python.

**🌟 What this project focuses on**

* Cleaning and preparing the dataset
* Exploring relationships between features
* Visualizing trends that influence car pricing
* Understanding which car attributes add more value

Instead of predicting prices, the focus is on insights and real-world interpretation.

**🧰 Tools used**

* Google Colab
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**📊 Major insights from the analysis**

Here are some meaningful patterns observed:

* Some brands have clearly higher average price ranges than others
* Fuel type and condition impact pricing in noticeable ways
* Mileage and age of a car strongly affect its value
* Engine capacity, transmission type, and model frequency play a role too

**📸 Output / Results (Screenshots)**

I produced 16 visualizations capturing multiple perspectives on the data.adding them in README will show all insights.
