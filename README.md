**🚗 Car Price Data Analysis Project**

This project is about exploring and understanding how different factors affect car prices. I worked with a dataset that contains details such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, transmission, and condition. My goal was to analyze the data and visualize interesting patterns — not to build a machine learning model.
The entire analysis was done in Google Colab using Python.

**🌟 What this project focuses on**

* Cleaning and preparing the dataset
* Exploring relationships between features
* Visualizing trends that influence car pricing
* Understanding which car attributes add more value

Instead of predicting prices, the focus is on insights and real-world interpretation.

**🧰 Tools used**

* Google Colab
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**📊 Major insights from the analysis**

Here are some meaningful patterns observed:

* Some brands have clearly higher average price ranges than others
* Fuel type and condition impact pricing in noticeable ways
* Mileage and age of a car strongly affect its value
* Engine capacity, transmission type, and model frequency play a role too

**🎯 Why I Did This Project**

Because I believe data has stories to tell. With this analysis, I aimed to uncover real patterns — not just numbers — that influence car pricing. It sharpened my analytical thinking and helped me see how everyday data can reflect real-world trends.

**🙏 Final Thoughts**

This project reflects a small but valuable step in my journey of understanding data analysis. I believe that even simple data exploration — when done carefully — can reveal interesting and useful insights.
